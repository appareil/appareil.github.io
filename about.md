<p>Since 2007, I have worked in Lafayette for <a href="http://www.emerymcclure.com">emerymcclure architecture</a> and in New Orleans for <a href="http://www.eskewdumezripple.com">Eskew+Dumez+Ripple</a>, taking on all roles ranging from programming and design to construction management. In 2013, I relocated to New York City to work with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/case-design-inc">CASE Inc</a>, focusing on building data and construction technology.</p>

<p>I am currently in New York City with <a href="https://www.wework.com">WeWork</a>.</p>
